**Solution**: 
- Ensure the service account email is shared on your Google Sheet
- Check that the permission level is correct (Editor for write access)
- Verify the Sheet ID in the URL is correct

#### 3. "Invalid Google Sheets URL" Error
**Solution**: 
- Use the full Google Sheets URL from your browser
- Format: `https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/SHEET_ID/edit`
- Make sure the sheet is not private/restricted

#### 4. "Write operations not allowed" Error
**Solution**: Change the access level from "Read Only" to "Read & Write" in the integration settings.

#### 5. Sheet Not Found Error
**Solution**: 
- Check the sheet/tab name is correct
- Default is usually "Sheet1"
- Make sure the tab exists in your spreadsheet

### Best Practices

1. **Descriptive Integration Names**: Use clear names like "Customer Database" instead of "Sheet1"

2. **Detailed Descriptions**: Help the AI understand your data by describing what's in each column

3. **Appropriate Access Levels**: Use read-only for reference data, read-write for operational data

4. **Regular Backups**: Keep backups of important spreadsheets before enabling write access

5. **Test Commands**: Start with simple read operations before trying complex updates

## üìù Data Format Guidelines

### For Best Results:
- Use headers in the first row
- Keep data consistent within columns
- Avoid merged cells where possible
- Use clear, descriptive column names

### Example Good Structure:
```
A1: Name | B1: Email | C1: Phone | D1: Status | E1: Notes
A2: John Doe | B2: john@email.com | C2: 555-1234 | D2: Active | E2: Premium customer
```

## üîê Security Notes

- Service account credentials should be kept secure
- Only share sheets that you want the AI to access
- Use read-only access when possible
- Review permissions regularly
- The AI can only access sheets explicitly shared with the service account

## üÜò Need Help?

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the console for detailed error messages
2. Verify your service account setup
3. Confirm sheet sharing permissions
4. Try simpler commands first
5. Check that your .env file is properly configured

## üéâ Success!

Once set up, you'll have a powerful natural language interface to your Google Sheets data. The AI can help you manage, analyze, and update your spreadsheets using simple conversational commands!
