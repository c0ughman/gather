# ðŸ”„ n8n Integration Guide for Gather

## Overview
The n8n integration allows you to trigger complex automation workflows using natural language commands through your AI agents. Connect to hundreds of services and create sophisticated multi-step automations with n8n's powerful workflow engine.

## How It Works

### 1. **Natural Language Activation**
Tell your AI agent what process you want to start:
- "Process the customer data"
- "Generate the weekly report"
- "Sync data between systems"
- "Monitor the API status"
- "Analyze the sales data"

### 2. **n8n Workflow Execution**
Your AI agent triggers the appropriate n8n workflow based on:
- **Description**: What you tell the AI the workflow does
- **Keywords**: Optional trigger words for precise matching
- **Context**: Understanding the business process you want to execute

### 3. **Complex Automation**
The n8n workflow executes multiple steps automatically, handling data transformation, API calls, notifications, and more.

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Create a Workflow in n8n
1. Open your n8n instance (cloud or self-hosted)
2. Click **"New Workflow"**
3. Add a **"Webhook"** node as your trigger
4. Configure the webhook:
   - Method: `POST`
   - Path: Choose a descriptive path (e.g., `/customer-processing`)
   - Copy the webhook URL
5. Build your workflow with additional nodes
6. Save and activate your workflow

### Step 2: Add n8n Integration in Gather
1. Go to **Settings** â†’ **Integrations**
2. Find **"n8n Workflow"** in the Action Integrations
3. Click **"Add Integration"**

### Step 3: Configure the Integration

#### Required Fields:
- **n8n Webhook URL**: Paste the webhook URL from Step 1
- **Workflow Name**: Give your workflow a descriptive name
  ```
  Example: "Customer Data Processing Pipeline"
  ```
- **What does this workflow do?**: Describe the automation in natural language
  ```
  Example: "Process new customer data, validate information, sync with CRM, send welcome emails, and generate analytics reports"
  ```

#### Optional Fields:
- **Data to Send**: JSON payload with dynamic variables
  ```json
  {
    "source": "ai_assistant",
    "timestamp": "{{timestamp}}",
    "user_input": "{{user_message}}",
    "contact": "{{contact_name}}",
    "workflow_trigger": "voice_command",
    "priority": "normal"
  }
  ```

- **Success Message**: What to show when the workflow starts
  ```
  "Customer data processing workflow started successfully!"
  ```

- **Trigger Keywords**: Comma-separated keywords for better matching
  ```
  "process, analyze, generate, sync, monitor"
  ```

### Step 4: Test Your Integration
1. Save the integration
2. Start a conversation with your AI agent
3. Say something like: "Process the new customer data from today"
4. Check that your workflow triggered in n8n
5. Monitor the workflow execution and results

## Advanced Configuration

### Dynamic Variables
Use these variables in your JSON payload:

| Variable | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `{{timestamp}}` | Current ISO timestamp | `2024-01-15T10:30:00.000Z` |
| `{{user_message}}` | Your exact request | `"process customer data"` |
| `{{contact_name}}` | AI agent name | `"Data Processing Assistant"` |

{
  "source": "ai_assistant",
  "timestamp": "{{timestamp}}",
  "user_input": "{{user_message}}",
  "contact": "{{contact_name}}",
  "workflow_trigger": "voice_command",
  "execution_context": {
    "priority": "normal",

  },
  "metadata": {
    "platform": "gather",
    "version": "1.0",
    "integration_type": "n8n_webhook"
  }
}
```

### Workflow Response Handling
n8n workflows can return data that the AI agent can use:

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "workflow_id": "customer_processing_001",
  "execution_time": "2.3s",
  "results": {
    "processed_records": 45,
    "success_count": 43,
    "error_count": 2,
    "summary": "Successfully processed 43 out of 45 customer records"
  },
  "next_steps": [
    "Review error logs for failed records",
    "Send confirmation email to stakeholders"
  ]
}
```

### Multiple Workflows per Agent
You can add multiple n8n integrations to one AI agent:
- Data processing workflow
- Report generation workflow
- Monitoring workflow
- Sync workflow

The AI will automatically choose the best workflow based on your request.

## n8n Workflow Best Practices

### 1. **Error Handling**
- Add error handling nodes to catch failures
- Implement retry logic for API calls
- Send notifications when workflows fail
- Log errors for debugging

### 2. **Data Validation**
- Validate incoming webhook data
- Check required fields are present
- Sanitize user inputs
- Handle edge cases gracefully

### 3. **Performance Optimization**
- Use parallel execution where possible
- Implement caching for repeated operations
- Optimize database queries
- Set appropriate timeouts

### 4. **Security**
- Validate webhook signatures if possible
- Sanitize all inputs
- Use environment variables for secrets
- Implement proper authentication

### 5. **Monitoring**
- Add logging throughout the workflow
- Track execution metrics
- Set up alerts for failures
- Monitor performance trends

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **Workflow not triggering**:
   - Check the webhook URL is correct and accessible
   - Verify the workflow is activated in n8n
   - Test the webhook directly with a tool like Postman

2. **Workflow failing**:
   - Check n8n execution logs for error details
   - Verify all required data is being sent
   - Test individual nodes in the workflow

3. **Wrong workflow triggered**:
   - Make descriptions more specific and distinct
   - Add relevant keywords to improve matching
   - Review the AI's decision-making logic

4. **Data not processing correctly**:
   - Validate JSON payload structure
   - Check data types match n8n expectations
   - Verify field mappings in workflow nodes

### Debugging Tips:
- Use n8n's execution history to trace issues
- Test workflows manually before connecting to Gather
- Start with simple workflows and add complexity gradually
- Use n8n's built-in debugging tools
