# ðŸ”— Zapier Integration Guide for Gather

## Overview
The Zapier integration allows you to trigger Zaps (automated workflows) using natural language commands through your AI agents. Connect to 5000+ apps and services through Zapier's powerful automation platform.

## How It Works

### 1. **Natural Language Activation**
Simply tell your AI agent what you want to automate:
- "Send this to Slack"
- "Add this customer to my CRM"
- "Create a calendar event"
- "Start my marketing workflow"
- "Post this update to social media"

### 2. **Zapier Integration**
Your AI agent triggers the appropriate Zap based on:
- **Description**: What you tell the AI the Zap does
- **Keywords**: Optional trigger words for precise matching
- **Context**: Understanding the intent behind your request

### 3. **Automatic Execution**
The Zap runs automatically in Zapier, connecting to your apps and performing the actions you've configured.

4. Select **"Catch Hook"** as the trigger event

### Multiple Zaps per Agent
You can add multiple Zapier integrations to one AI agent:
- Marketing automation Zap
- CRM management Zap  
- Calendar scheduling Zap
- Social media posting Zap

The AI will automatically choose the best Zap based on your request.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **Zap not triggering**: 
   - Check the webhook URL is correct
   - Verify the Zap is published and turned on
   - Test the webhook directly in Zapier

2. **Wrong Zap triggered**: 
   - Refine your description to be more specific
   - Add relevant keywords
   - Make descriptions distinct between different Zaps

3. **Data not passing correctly**: 
   - Check your JSON payload syntax
   - Verify variable names match what your Zap expects
   - Test with simple data first

4. **Authentication errors**: 
   - Ensure connected apps in Zapier are properly authenticated
   - Check that app permissions are sufficient

### Testing Tips:
- Start with simple Zaps (like sending to Slack)
- Use Zapier's task history to debug issues
- Test webhook URLs directly before adding to Gather
- Keep descriptions clear and specific

## Best Practices

### Writing Good Descriptions:
- Be specific about what the Zap does
- Include the target app/service name
- Mention the type of action (send, create, update, etc.)
- Use business context the AI can understand

### Choosing Keywords:
- Include action words (send, create, add, post, schedule)
- Add app names (slack, gmail, calendar, crm)
- Include domain-specific terms
- Add synonyms for better matching

### Natural Commands:
- Speak naturally: "Please send this to the team"
- Use variations: "Post this update", "Share this news", "Announce this"
- Be conversational: "Can you add this customer to our system?"

## Security Notes

- Webhook URLs should be kept secure
- Only share Zaps that you want the AI to access
- Review Zapier task history regularly
- Use Zapier's built-in security features
- The AI can only trigger Zaps you explicitly configure
